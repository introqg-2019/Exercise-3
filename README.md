# Exercise 3: Hillslope diffusion

The objective of this week's exercise is to compute hillslope profiles assuming hillslope evolution is a diffusion process.
As discussed in lecture, the hillslope diffusion model is based on the principal of conservation of mass, which states that the changes in surface elevation are proportional to the soil/sediment flux along the hillslope.

This exercise is based on [a MATLAB exercise from Prof. Todd Ehlers (Uni TÃ¼bingen)](http://www.mnf.uni-tuebingen.de/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/mineralogie-geodynamik/forschungsbereich/geologie-geodynamik/workgroup.html).
